            <h2>ONE DIRECTION</h2>
            <p>The band, comprised of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and formerly Zayn Malik until his departure in March 2015, achieved remarkable success as one of the best-selling boy groups. They entered the spotlight by securing the third position in the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010 and subsequently signed with Simon Cowell's Syco Records.</p>

            <p>Fueled by social media, One Direction's albums - "Up All Night" (2011), "Take Me Home" (2012), "Midnight Memories" (2013), "Four" (2014), and "Made in the A.M." (2015) - claimed chart-topping positions globally. Their singles, including "What Makes You Beautiful," "Live While We're Young," "Best Song Ever," "Story of My Life," and "Drag Me Down," enjoyed considerable success.</p>
          
            <p>Notably, with the release of "Four," One Direction achieved a historic feat on the US Billboard 200 by having their first four albums debut at number one. "Midnight Memories" stood out as the best-selling album worldwide in 2013.</p>
          
            <p>Acknowledged as teen idols, the band experienced fervent fan hysteria and embarked on four world tours, two of which were stadium-wide. The "Where We Are Tour," supporting "Midnight Memories," set records as the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014 and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time.</p>
          
            <p>In January 2016, the group announced an indefinite hiatus, allowing members to explore individual projects. As of 2020, One Direction has sold a total of 70 million records worldwide, solidifying their status as one of the best-selling boy bands. Their extensive list of accolades includes seven Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, and numerous others.</p>
          
            <p>In 2013, Forbes recognized them as the second-highest-earning celebrities under 30. They were also named the Global Recording Artist of the Year in 2013 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Billboard honored them as the "Artist of the Year" in 2014, and Forbes ranked them among the highest-earning celebrities worldwide in 2015 and 2016.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>

                <p><strong>2010–2011: The X Factor</strong></p>
              
                <p>One Direction, consisting of Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson, initially auditioned as solo candidates for the 2010 series of the British singing competition The X Factor. They failed to progress in the "Boys" category at the bootcamp stage but were instead formed into a five-piece boy band, qualifying for the "Groups" category. American singer Nicole Scherzinger and long-time judge Simon Cowell claimed credit for the idea of forming the band, with a later video confirming Scherzinger's significant role in their formation.</p>
              
                <p>The band members—Horan, Styles, Tomlinson, Payne, and Malik—came together for two weeks to get to know each other and rehearse. Styles suggested the band's name. For their qualifying song at "judges' houses" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "Torn." Cowell was impressed, stating that they were "confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well." Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they became Cowell's final act in the competition and quickly gained popularity in the UK.</p>
              
                <p>One Direction were the last contestants eliminated in the competition. Immediately after the final, their song "Forever Young," which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, leaked onto the internet. Soon after, it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011 as they flew to Los Angeles to work with record producer RedOne. A book licensed by One Direction, "One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)," was published by HarperCollins in February 2011, subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list.</p>
              
                <p>In the same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour, performing for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.</p>

                <h1>Take Me Home</h1>
                <p>One Direction at the red carpet of the Logie Awards of 2012 in Melbourne.</p>
                
                <p>In September 2012, "Live While We're Young," the lead single from the group's second album, was released and was a global success. It reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US. A second single, "Little Things," resulted in the band's second number one single in the UK.</p>
                
                <p>In November 2012, One Direction's second studio album, <em>Take Me Home</em>, was released. It sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than thirty-four other countries. Additionally, <em>Up All Night</em> and <em>Take Me Home</em> were the number three and number four best-selling albums of 2012 globally, each album selling over 4.4 million units worldwide.</p>
                
                <p>Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits "What Makes You Beautiful" and "One Thing," spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album.</p>
                
                <p>The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red telephone box, a familiar sight on the streets of the UK. Take Me Home garnered generally favorable reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production although it was criticized for its generic, rushed nature.</p>
                
                <p>One Direction performed "Little Things" at the 2012 Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, and headlined a sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden on 3 December 2012. In February 2013, One Direction released a cover version of "One Way or Another" and "Teenage Kicks," "One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)," as the 2013 Comic Relief single. The charity single reached number one in the UK and Ireland alongside various other countries while peaking at 13 in the US. As part of their involvement with the UK charity, One Direction traveled to Ghana to volunteer at a children's hospital, visit a school, and make donations.</p>
