            <h1>Take Me Home</h1>
            <p>One Direction at the red carpet of the Logie Awards of 2012 in Melbourne.</p>
            
            <p>In September 2012, "Live While We're Young," the lead single from the group's second album, was released and was a global success. It reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US. A second single, "Little Things," resulted in the band's second number one single in the UK.</p>
            
            <p>In November 2012, One Direction's second studio album, <em>Take Me Home</em>, was released. It sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than thirty-four other countries. Additionally, <em>Up All Night</em> and <em>Take Me Home</em> were the number three and number four best-selling albums of 2012 globally, each album selling over 4.4 million units worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits "What Makes You Beautiful" and "One Thing," spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album.</p>
            
            <p>The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red telephone box, a familiar sight on the streets of the UK. Take Me Home garnered generally favorable reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production although it was criticized for its generic, rushed nature.</p>
            
            <p>One Direction performed "Little Things" at the 2012 Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, and headlined a sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden on 3 December 2012. In February 2013, One Direction released a cover version of "One Way or Another" and "Teenage Kicks," "One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)," as the 2013 Comic Relief single. The charity single reached number one in the UK and Ireland alongside various other countries while peaking at 13 in the US. As part of their involvement with the UK charity, One Direction traveled to Ghana to volunteer at a children's hospital, visit a school, and make donations.</p>
