            <h2>ONE DIRECTION</h2>
            <p>One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London in 2010. The group 
                is composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and previously Zayn Malik until his
                 departure from the group in March 2015. They became one of the best-selling boy groups of all time before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016.
                The group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and placing third in the seventh 
                series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to global
                 success by social media, One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), 
                 Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in several countries, 
                 and generated hit singles including "What Makes You Beautiful" (their first number one on the UK Singles Chart, 
                 and the highest debut for a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1998), "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down". After the release of Four,
                 One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one.
                 Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the best-selling album worldwide of 2013.</p>
                 <p>The band, comprised of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and formerly Zayn Malik until his departure in March 2015, achieved remarkable success as one of the best-selling boy groups. They entered the spotlight by securing the third position in the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010 and subsequently signed with Simon Cowell's Syco Records.</p>

                 <p>Fueled by social media, One Direction's albums - "Up All Night" (2011), "Take Me Home" (2012), "Midnight Memories" (2013), "Four" (2014), and "Made in the A.M." (2015) - claimed chart-topping positions globally. Their singles, including "What Makes You Beautiful," "Live While We're Young," "Best Song Ever," "Story of My Life," and "Drag Me Down," enjoyed considerable success.</p>
               
                 <p>Notably, with the release of "Four," One Direction achieved a historic feat on the US Billboard 200 by having their first four albums debut at number one. "Midnight Memories" stood out as the best-selling album worldwide in 2013.</p>
               
                 <p>Acknowledged as teen idols, the band experienced fervent fan hysteria and embarked on four world tours, two of which were stadium-wide. The "Where We Are Tour," supporting "Midnight Memories," set records as the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014 and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time.</p>
